		  <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
		  <p>Thank you for visiting my home page.
		     My name is Rohit Banga. I am a Software Developer working at Amazon Web Services
                     on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">AWS ElasticBeanstalk</a>.
		     I recently completed my MS in Computer Science at
		     <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>.
		     I was born and brought up in India and I love home made Indian food.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		     I wrote my first "Hello World" program in the summer of 2003 in C++ compiled
		     using Turbo C++ Compiler on an old i386 PC.
		     Programming has been my passion since then. As a student and a professional
		     developer I have tried to diversify my knowledgebase by working on projects
		     from different fields and also working on different parts of the software stack.

                    <h3>Recent Project</h3>
                    <p>
		    As a Master's student I was working on <a href="http://v2v.cc.gatech.edu">C4G Vein-to-Vein</a>
		    an open source software solution for tracking
		    the lifecycle of blood from the point of donation to transfusion.
		    My advisor for this project was <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/">Dr. Santosh Vempala</a>.
		    This software product is aimed at replacing the manual procedure adopted for managing
		    blood products in several developing countries of Africa.
		    C4G Vein-to-Vein started as a collaboration between the
		    <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/about/advancing/c4g/">Computing for Good (C4G) </a>
		    program at Georgia Tech,
		    the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a>, Safe Blood for Africa and the participating countries of Africa.
                    Initially developed at Georgia Tech, this project is now being maintained by
                    <a href="http://www.jembi.org/">Jembi</a> under the name
                    <a href="https://github.com/jembi/bsis">Blood Safety Information System (BSIS)</a>.
